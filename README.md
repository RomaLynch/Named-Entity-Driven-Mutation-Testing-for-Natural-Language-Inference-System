# Named-Entity-Driven-Mutation-Testing-for-NLI-system
## This repository stores the experimental code we wrote for the paper "Named-Entity-Driven-Mutation-Testing-for-Natural-Language-Inference-System".
# Datasets
## We use three NLI datasets: MNLI, SNLI, and MultiNLI. We mainly use test sets of MNLI and SNLI, and we extract 30,000 samples from MultiNLI. We put these three datasets in the dataset folder.
